Real estate app

The business plan of the app will be as follows:
There will be 2 types of users: Agents and Buyers.

Agents will have to buy subscription to the app to be able to post properties.
This group will be the one that will spend money and bring profit for the app.
We will use in-app purchase for this, you can decide on subscription plan, like monthly etc.
Agents will be able to post unlimited number of properties for sale on the platform.
Buyers (free subscription) will be able to post 1 property only in for sale section, and search the listings, contact the agent to view or purchase the property.
Guests that didn’t register will be able to use the app to search their desired properties, but they won’t be able to contact the Agents to arrange viewing or buying the property. Also, they cannot post any properties in for sale section.
This is done to get more users to register for the app. Also, Buyer can update to Agent at any time after registration.
